This folder contains the **code** for running the experiments of the 6 Nearest Neighbor methods.

The **data** in csv format with pretrained fastText embeddings are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UbGzaJAGOgzBngPhwDDWPa_CJIH8yZCP?usp=sharing). Every dataset DX consists of three files:

1) DXAemb.csv, which contains the entity profiles of E1
2) DXBemb.csv, which contains the entity profiles of E2
3) DXgroundtruth.csv, which contains the duplicate pairs

The first two files are compressed in **DX.7z**.
