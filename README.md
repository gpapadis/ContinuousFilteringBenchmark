# Continuous Benchmark of Filtering methods for Entity Resolution

**Entity Resolution** constitutes a core data integration task of *quadratic time complexity*.
As a result, it scales to large datasets through methods that *filtering techniques*, which reduce its computational cost to *candidate pairs*.
These are pairs of similar entity profiles that are highly likely to be matching.
Three types of filtering methods have been proposed in the literature:

 1) Blocking workflows
 2) String similarity joins
 3) Nearest neighbor methods
 
The goal of this repository is to provide and data for benchmarking the relative performance of the main methods of these three types.
